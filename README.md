#JS, the DOM, and AJAX

## Getting Started
- create your virtualenv
- install pip requirements


## APIs! APIs! APIs!
This exercise will deviate slightly from the regular workflow. We have written the python backend code for you that your todo list app will be intergrating with.


## Extra Credit

- add support to reorder items in the todo list
- add bootstrap
